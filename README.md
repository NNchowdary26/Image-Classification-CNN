# Natural Scenes Image Dataset

This repository contains image data of natural scenes from around the world, originally published by Intel for an image classification challenge on [Analytics Vidhya](https://datahack.analyticsvidhya.com).

## 📂 Content

The dataset consists of approximately **25,000 images** of size **150x150 pixels** categorized into six classes:

| Category   | Label |
|------------|-------|
| Buildings  | 0     |
| Forest     | 1     |
| Glacier    | 2     |
| Mountain   | 3     |
| Sea        | 4     |
| Street     | 5     |

The dataset is divided into three separate zip files:
- **Train Data**: ~14,000 images
- **Test Data**: ~3,000 images
- **Prediction Data**: ~7,000 images

## 📦 Dataset Structure

Each zip file contains images organized into folders corresponding to the six categories.
